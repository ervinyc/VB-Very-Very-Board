CST 4708 exercise to create a window forms application of snowboard rental

information for each rental. In addition, calculate 
the summary information for each day's rentals. 

For each rental, input the person's name, driver's license
or ID number, the number of snowboards, and the number of 
snowboards with boots. Snowboards without boots cost $20,
and snowboards with boots $30.

Calculate and display the charges for the snowboards and 
snowboards with boots, and the rental total. In addition 
maintain summary totals. Use constants for the various 
rates.

Create a summary frame with boxes to indicate the daily 
totals. for snowboards, snowboards with boots, total 
charges and the average charge per customer.
Include buttons for Calculate order, Clear, Clear ALL, 
Print and Exit. The Clear ALL should clear the summary 
totals to begin a new day's summary.
